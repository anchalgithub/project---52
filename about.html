<h2> This website was made by Candy and her team. Candy knows how to code in javascript, html and css. She enjoys doing this and wanted to share her experience with the world. So, she has created a origami website where you, my friend, can learn how to make all sorts of animals! You can also learn some new and interesting facts about those animals you may have not known. Follow her on instagram, youtube and facebook on the original page to keep up with all her adventures. :) </h2>
